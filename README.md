# Learning-Chrome-Extention-Projects
Tutorial Projects for me to learn how to make a Google Chrome Extention. These are projects that I am working on to learn how to create Google Chrome Extentions. These are my first Chrome Extentions.

# Note
- The Getting Started Extension is the [Getting Started Chrome Extention Tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted). This extention allows the user to change the background color of the chrome developer website.
- The Hello World extention is the example Hello World Google Chrome extension found on [What are Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions). This extension displays a popup that says 'Hello World' when the extension is clicked or when the shortcul 'control'+'shift'+'f' is triggered.
